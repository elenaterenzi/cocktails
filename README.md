Cocktails Asp.Net WebApp.

This web app was coded in spare time. The sole purpose was having fun and learning C#.

As the [license](./LICENSE) states, this code is provided and can be used at your own risk.

The maintainers of this repository refuse any liability to how the code is used.

## Contents
This repository also includes a sample Dockerfile which will build the web app only. The assumption is you have a companion database (container?) available. This solution does not include the database structure.
